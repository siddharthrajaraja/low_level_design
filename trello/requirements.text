Problem Statement
Create an application like Trello which is a project management application, where you can manage your project by tracking smaller tasks. For reference : https://trello.com/

Basic Features and workings :
The application contains multiple boards to signify different projects
Each board contains different lists to signify sub-project
Each list contain different cards signifying smaller tasks
Each card can be assigned to a user or may remain unassigned

Definitions :
User: Each user should have a userId, name, email.
Board: Each board should have a id, name, privacy (PUBLIC/PRIVATE), url, members, lists
List: Each list should have a id, name and cards
Card: Each card should have a id, name, description, assigned user, priority, created time, finished time, ETA, status

Requirements :
We should be able to create/delete boards, add/remove people from the members list and modify attributes. Deleting a board should delete all lists inside it.
We should be able to create/delete lists and modify attributes. Deleting a list should delete all cards inside it.
We should be able to create/delete cards, assign/unassign a member to the card and modify attributes.
We should also be able to move cards across lists in the same board
Ability to show all boards, a single board, a single list and a single card
Default privacy should be public
Cards should be unassigned by default
Ids should be auto-generated for board/list/card

Bonus for SDE1 :
Bookmark (add to favorite) card/list/board. Show userâ€™s bookmarked cards/lists/boards

Additional Complexity for SDE2 :
Search by filter / sort - assigned user / created date range / ETA / priority etc
Watch (subscribe to changes on card/board) - user should get informed for the changes.

Bonus for SDE2 :
Handling concurrency when multiple users edit the same card.
